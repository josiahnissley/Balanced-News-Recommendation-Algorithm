# Balanced News Recommendation Algorithm

Objective Statement: _This project aimed to develop a recommendation algorithm that curates a balanced newsfeed by delivering articles users are less than 75% likely to engage with 50% of the time, while the remaining 50% features content aligned with their preferences. The goal was to retain user engagement while mitigating polarization, reducing media bias, and promote exposure to diverse perspectives._

__1. Data__

I decided to use the Microsoft News Dataset (MIND) which is a large-scale benchmark for news recommendation research, collected from anonymized behavior logs of the Microsoft News website. It includes around 160k English news articles and over 15 million impression logs from 1 million users. Each article contains detailed content, including title, abstract, and category, while impression logs record click events, non-clicked events, and a user's historical interactions with news.
